Code should follow Go/Golang best practices.

Commit messages should follow the format of:

```markdown
Short summary of what changed in the code/repo in this commit

After an empty newline, any further details to explain the intent behind this change, and the motivation why we wanted to make it. This context will be helpful in the future when someone is looking back at the history of the repo to try and understand why some code changed.
```
